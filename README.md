TL;DR: An RPG back-end for playing around with design, architecture, and patterns.

What the heck is this?
==========

Through-out high school and university, I had a bunch of little hobby projects that I could pour a ton of time into to try and develop my ability to program. Once I started down the path of my full-time career, this kind of thing dropped off pretty quick. I'm really interested in the work I do for my job, so why waste time doing this hobby stuff? Afterall, it's not going anywhere...

I've recently changed my mind on this. After not having pet projects for a while (yeah, even ones like this that I don't expect to take off and make me millions of dollars or become the next OpenSource goldmine), I've realized that my ability to stay sharp on programming trends and designs is declining. That is, when I have stuff like this to work on then I can practice all kinds of new and crazy things without the pressure from my job.

With all of that said, I decided to make a back-end for an RPG. Why? Because I've done this a million times, and I love going back and revisitting (or re-writing) the stuff I thought I did well... Because then I can see how much I've learned. Another reason is because I don't have the problem domain holding me back (I love RPGs, I love video games, I love lamp) and I can focus on my code.
